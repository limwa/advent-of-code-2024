# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge.

This year, I've decided to complete the challenge in Go! I've also decided to use the [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) feature of Nix to manage my solutions.

> Thank you to [alexchao26](https://github.com/alexchao26) for their [alexchao26/advent-of-code-go](https://github.com/alexchao26/advent-of-code-go) repository, which served as a great starting point for this project.
